🌍 StayScape – Full Stack Travel Accommodation Platform

📌StayScape is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, built to explore and manage travel accommodation listings. The project focuses on implementing real-world backend functionality, authentication workflows, database-driven features, and a clean, user-friendly interface.
<br>
📌This project was developed to strengthen my understanding of full-stack development by working on an end-to-end application rather than isolated features.
<br>

📍 Project Purpose
<br>
This project was built as a learning-focused full-stack application to apply backend concepts, database design, and user authentication in a practical environment while also paying attention to UI/UX and user experience.

🚀 Features
<br>
▫️User authentication and authorization using Passport.js<br>
▫️User registration, login, and logout functionality<br>
▫️Create, edit, and delete accommodation listings (CRUD operations)<br>
▫️Wishlist functionality with heart toggle for saved listings<br>
▫️Image upload and storage using Cloudinary<br>
▫️Form validation using Joi<br>
▫️Flash messages for user feedback<br>
▫️Session management and secure cookies<br>
▫️Dynamic routing and RESTful API structure<br>
▫️Responsive UI built with Bootstrap and EJS templates<br>
▫️Add and delete reviews and ratings for listings<br>
▫️Implemented search and filter functionality<br>
<br>

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used
<br>
▫️Frontend technologies include HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and EJS for server-side rendering<br>
▫️Backend built using Node.js and Express.js<br>
▫️Database managed using MongoDB with MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting<br>
▫️Mongoose used for schema design, data modeling, and database operations<br>
▫️Authentication implemented using Passport.js, Passport-Local, and Passport-Local-Mongoose<br>
▫️Image upload handling using Multer and Multer-Storage-Cloudinary<br>
▫️Cloudinary used for cloud-based image storage and retrieval<br>
▫️Form validation handled using Joi<br>
▫️Session management using Express-Session and Cookie-Parser<br>
▫️Flash messages implemented using Connect-Flash<br>
▫️Environment variables managed using Dotenv<br>
▫️Method-Override used to support PUT and DELETE requests<br>
<br>

🧠 Application Architecture
<br>
▫️The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to maintain clean separation of concerns.<br>
▫️Models handle database schemas and relationships.<br>
▫️Views are created using EJS templates for dynamic server-side rendering.<br>
Controllers manage business logic and route handling.<br>
▫️This structure improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
<br>

🌐 Database & Cloud Services
<br>
▫️MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud database for storing user and listing data.<br>
Cloudinary is integrated to store and manage uploaded images efficiently.<br>
<br>

📚 Learning Outcomes
<br>
▫️Gained hands-on experience in building a complete full-stack application<br>
